# FAQ

## How do I download this?
Follow the instructions above.

## Why does this exist?
Backing up Neos content given the current circumstances seemed wise.

## Can I restore this download into my Neos Account?
No.

## What can I do with the downloaded files?
The files are mostly machine readable collections of entities from your account, feel free to poke around.

You could however, write additional tools that do stuff with them.

## Can I import downloaded content into Unity?
This is not a supported use case of this utility. No effort will be made to support this. You could make your own tooling to do that though.

## Should I use a new folder for each user/group I download?
Ideally no, the local store that this app builds will in some cases handle duplicate assets in a way that will reduce total file size if you use the same folder for multiple accounts. The download location can handle as many accounts as needed.

## Can I run this app for multiple users at the same time?
Yes, but if you do this, you'll need to use two separate folders which we do not recommend. You may also breach some rate limits Neos has in place on its cloud infrastructure.

## Do subsequent downloads, re-download assets?
For assets, we skip downloading them if an existing asset is found. This makes many downloads incremental rather than starting from scratch.

## Why is assets  showing as 0/XYZ?
For assets, we skip downloading them if an existing asset is found. If your progress statistics or report etc. show 0/xyz etc then it means that no new assets were found.

## What's the difference between Assets and Records/Items/Worlds/Avatars?
This diagram might help:
![](docs/AssetsVsNonAssets.png)

- Assets: Anything that makes up an element in Neos that is not the structure of it within the inspector. So Image,Sounds,Videos,Model Files. These are downloaded incrementally
- Records: Records contain a manifest of all assets that are required to represent an item or world. These are downloaded each time.
- Everything Else: JSON Soup. Just JSON Files of various types. Contacts, Messages etc. These are downloaded each time.

## How do I report a bug?
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/GuVAnj8Gv3RJ/NeosAccountDownloader/issues) the format doesn't really matter provided you clearly explain your problem and provide a log file if you'd like.

## Can I submit a log file privately?
Sure, email one to: guvanj8gv3rj.undertook642@passinbox.com I know its awkward but that goes straight to the author no one else.

## What are Asset/Record failures?
At the end of your download you might see asset or record failures.

- A record failure usually means that an entire item/world/avatar failed to download, you won't have any assets from that record because the tool could not download the Record to find them
- An asset failure means a part of a downloaded record could not be downloaded.

In both cases, make sure you take a look at the UI scrolling left and right etc. Better UI for this area might be a focus if we continue to see errors. In both events the details are logged to your log files too.

## Where do I find the log files?
In the top bar menu for the tool click Help -> Open Log Folder. It'll take you right there.

# Known Issues

## Localization isn't instant
If you switch languages then the currently active page you're on will not update to the new language. 

Localization defaults to your computer's language, so for most people this hopefully should not be a problem, but for now change your language on the Getting Started screen.

## Progress Metrics aren't 100% Accurate
Neos assets and records are stored in a way that makes it difficult for us to estimate the total number of records required for download. Due to this we sometimes discover more that need to be queued for download as we go. Causing numbers to jump around a little bit.

# Contributing
Thanks for your interest in contributing, in all cases except for localization please open an issue before opening a PR.

## Localization
We'd love help with localization.

You have two options when localizing.

### Weblate (Preferred)
We're trying out Weblate for online localization, it will enable you to localize Neos Account Downloader without downloading anything from right in your browser, it is really cool.

[![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/neos-account-downloader/-/neos-account-downloader-resources/287x66-white.png)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/neos-account-downloader/)

We're still setting up Weblate but tune in soon for some more information.
